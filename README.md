# french-project

My 2022 French final and also first attempt at web development using React. 

To go to the site, click the "github-pages" under Environments to the right, then "View Deployment", or [click here](https://yellowly.github.io/french-project/).
Note that to view the site, you need to hover above the top of the webpage then go to "home", since I didn't know how to route paths when I made this. First time for everything!
